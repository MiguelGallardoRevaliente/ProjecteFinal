            <h2>How to play?</h2>
            <p>In this game, you start by choosing 8 cards from a pool of over 200 to form your deck. With your selected deck, you head into battle, 
                beginning with 20 mana. As you play, you'll use your mana to put cards onto the battlefield. Each card costs a certain amount of mana, 
                which is deducted from your total mana when played. Once on the battlefield, your cards can attack or be attacked. If a card is eliminated,
                the mana used to play that card is returned to you. For example, if a card costing 6 mana is eliminated, you get 6 mana back. <br>Each player takes turns,
                and each turn is limited to one minute. Unique abilities on your cards can only be used once per combat. The game ends when one player runs out of cards,
                and the player who still has cards remaining wins.
            </p>

            <h2>Chamous Lore</h2>
            <p>Centuries ago, in a magical and enigmatic world known as Chamous, the primordial energy of the universe converged into a unique epicenter: a floating city 
                high above the clouds, also named Chamous. This city, suspended between the skies and the stars, was the core of life and magic that flowed through the vast
                landscape of Chamous.
            </p>
            <p>In Chamous, the energy of the world, known as the "Radiance," manifested in nine distinct forms, each representing a unique and unparalleled power. These powers,
                in turn, were personified by nine legendary beings who became the guardians of Chamous. Each guardian was imbued with the essential power of one of the Nine Radiances, 
                and their duty was to preserve the magical balance that sustained the world.
            </p>
            <p>The Nine Radiances, and their respective guardians, were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Awesome, the Radiance of Light: Guardian of light and positive energy.</li>
                <li>Warlock/Waño, the Radiance of Darkness: Custodian of shadows and dark magic.</li>
                <li>Chimpy, the Radiance of Wind: Lord of winds and skies.</li>
                <li>GuRex, the Radiance of Water: Protector of oceans and waters.</li>
                <li>Tumse, the Radiance of the Forest: Defender of the earth and nature.</li>
                <li>Maza, the Neutral Radiance: Maintainer of balance and neutrality.</li>
                <li>Yasai, the Radiance of Poison: Guardian of toxicity and cunning.</li>
                <li>Rauru, the Radiance of Fire: Master of fire and flames.</li>
                <li>Morrality, the Radiance of Rock: Custodian of solidity and resilience.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Chamous, despite its apparent peace, witnesses a growing internal conflict. Differences of opinion among the guardians on how to use the Radiance to maintain harmony
                trigger tensions. While some advocate for the equitable and collaborative use of powers, others crave more control and dominance.</p>

            <p>
                The internal conflict threatens to shatter the delicate balance of Chamous, and players find themselves in the midst of a struggle to preserve the essence of the Nine
                 Radiances and restore fading harmony. Will they be able to overcome internal divisions and protect Chamous from the threat that arises from within?</p>
